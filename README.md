# Mars-surface-image-segmentation-dataset-for-Tianwen-1-Mission
Mars surface image segmentation dataset for Tianwen-1 Mission  
  
The compressed package images1, images2, images3, images4, images5 are the original images of the TWMARS dataset. These images are obtained by segmenting and filtering the images of the Martian surface captured by the Navigation Terrain Camera.  
(The segmentation process is to divide the image captured by the terrain navigation camera into four)  
  
The compressed package labels are the labelled images corresponding to images1-5.  
  
**The code of Mars rock segmentation is in the branch master https://github.com/BUPT-ANT-1007/Mars-surface-image-segmentation-dataset-for-Tianwen-1-Mission/tree/master**
